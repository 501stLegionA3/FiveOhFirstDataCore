# Getting Recruited
First step - join the 501st Legion | Starsim Discord with [this link](https://discord.gg/ygUupbenr4)

Once you are in the Discord, read the `#faq` channel and check the pinned messages in `#recruiter-open` for information about the unit.

You will also want to join the teamspeak at `ts3.501stlegion-a3.com`. Detailed instructions on how to contact a recruiter is in Discord, while modlist information is in the teamspeak.

Any questions about recruitment can be asked in the Discord.
