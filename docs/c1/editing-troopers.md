# Editing Troopers

## Before The Edit

2. The position in the C-Shop this trooper has a role for. In the case of Qualification/MOS Training Staff, there is a selection for each Qualification and MOS that has training staff.
3. The rank/role of the trooper withing their position. For an Assault instructor (or any other instructor), you can select Cadre, Instructor, or Lead. These options change depending on different positions in different C-Shops.
